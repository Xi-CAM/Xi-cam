Xi-CAM Documentation
====================

The :code:`Xi-CAM` package is a plugin-based framework and graphical user
interface (GUI) application for synchrotron data management, acquisition,
visualization, and analysis. Support for a variety of techniques is provided
through its plugin architecture.


Getting Started

Before starting to develop plugins, you will need to install Xi-CAM and some
of its dependencies.

Follow the QuickStart_ guide to get started with installation and
exploring an example Xi-CAM plugin (covers GUIPlugin, Workflow, and OperationPlugins).

For more detailed documentation, you may want to visit the following:
